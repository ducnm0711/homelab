# Homelab Repository

This repository serves as the initial building block for my future Home Server. It will house all the work, customizations, and research from my personal lab.

My homelab journey has always mirrored my career's growth. It evolved from an early-day, rag-tag bare-metal Kubernetes cluster, survived through the [OVHcloud fire in 2021](https://x.com/OVHcloud/status/1369609720005267460) and finally landing solid ground in AWS and GCP.

Now, with my life settled, it's time to give my beloved homelab a permanent, physical location. Inspired by my mentor's home setup in France, I'm embarking on a multi-year project to build my own Home Server.

This repository is the first brick. It will house all the work, customizations, and lab research that define my setup.
